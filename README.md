# Video Recorder
This repository is for testing the development of [`Homeisapp/react-native-image-crop-picker`](https://github.com/Homeisapp/react-native-image-crop-picker).

## Requirements:
Extend react-native-image-crop-picker package to enable video recording as part of the package.
Add a video recording feature to the react-native-image-crop-picker package

The API and response whould be in the same structure as the library current supports, in addition to new properties for video recording.

## Suggested API
This is our suggestion for the API, any change to the following structure is welcome as long as it's discussed and approved by us in advance.
```javascript
import ImagePicker from 'Homeisapp/react-native-image-crop-picker';
```

Initiating the video recorder:
```javascript
ImagePicker.openCamera({
  mediaType: 'video',
  compressVideoPreset: 'MediumQuality',
  includeExif: true
})
```
